# Milestone 1

## Feedback 

Great job on Milestone 1. Your directory structure is perfect. You have a few small errors in the HTML and .gitignore which I will go over later.  The persona, audience, and goal are also perfect and they lay the groundwork for the persona and use case. The persona lays out exactly what type of users will be using your site, and the use case lays out how the users will be interacting with the site. 

## Edits/Suggestions  

In the .gitignore  you misspelled /vendor that needs to be corrected right away.  You are also using the `<center>` tag which has been deprecated in favor of CSS https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/center. I would also be careful with the technology you lay out for the persona. By stating that your ideal user will be using Windows XP you would have to make your site is cross compatible with browsers that XP can run (Internet Explorer 6 yuck).

## Milestone 2a feedback

Your directory structure continues to look great, and your code has passed inspection by [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?acceptlanguage=&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbootcamp-coders.cnm.edu%2F~jhenson9%2Fmy-pwp-ryan%2Fpublic_html%2Fdocumentation%2Fmilestone-2.php), great job!

You've described your layout very clearly, and it matches your wireframes exactly. You've done a great job breaking up the flow of the page as well. However, I'm a little concerned that your PWP may be too text heavy, and lacking images or other media to break up the text. Have you given any thought to adding some type of media, or maybe some visually pleasing CSS to your PWP? I think it would go a long way towards enhancing your end user's experience. It doesn't have to be anything huge, but maybe showcasing some aspects of your projects, or previous work. Possibly adding some personal pictures, or landscapes? It's a personal choice, but I highly recommend adding some media to your layout.

You've passed milestone 2a with a [tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)! You're free to begin work on [milestone 2b](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/). **However**, I would like you to consider my comments above, and if you're on board to add media to your layout, please submit new wireframes with the media included. If you have any questions please let me know.
