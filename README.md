# Milestone 1

## Feedback 

Great job on Milestone 1. Your directory structure is perfect. You have a few small errors in the HTML and .gitignore which I will go over later.  The persona, audience, and goal are also perfect and they lay the groundwork for the persona and use case. The persona lays out exactly what type of users will be using your site, and the use case lays out how the users will be interacting with the site. 

## Edits/Suggestions  

In the .gitignore  you misspelled /vendor that needs to be corrected right away.  You are also using the <center> tag which has been deprecated in favor of CSS https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/center. I would also be careful with the technology you lay out for the persona. By stating that your ideal user will be using Windows XP you would have to make your site is cross compatible with browsers that XP can run (Internet Explorer 6 yuck).
